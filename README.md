The TaskManager application is a simple task management app made for demonstration purposes for the DevOps Engineer assignment 
1. Containerization: 
The TaskManager application follows a containerized architecture, where the backend and frontend are encapsulated within separate Docker containers. This ensures that both components are isolated from the host system, offering consistent and predictable behavior across different environments ( development, staging, and production).

Backend Container: The backend is built using Node.js and Docker. The backend Docker container is responsible for running the backend server, handling API requests, and interacting with the database.

Frontend Container: The frontend, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is also containerized in a separate Docker image. The frontend serves static files and runs on a local HTTP server for testing purposes.

First , I created both the Dockerfile for the frontend and the backend then built their images and pushed them to docker hub where i could then pull them
for the backend: 
docker build -f backend/Dockerfile -t hatemnefzi/taskmanager-backend:latest ./backend

for the frontend:
docker build -f frontend/Dockerfile -t hatemnefzi/taskmanager-frontend:latest ./frontend

SQLite3 Database Integration
The SQLite3 database is integrated into the backend container. Since SQLite is a file-based database, it doesnâ€™t require a separate container or a complex setup. The backend interacts directly with the SQLite3 database through the file system. The necessary SQLite3 commands are included in the backend code to handle database operations such as querying and storing tasks.

To streamline the deployment process and bring together the backend, frontend, and SQLite3 database, i created a  docker-compose.yml file . This file defines the following services:

Backend Service: This service builds and runs the backend container, ensuring that the backend application is accessible via port 8081.
Frontend Service: This service builds and runs the frontend container, which serves the static files via Nginx on port 80.
SQLite3 Database: Although SQLite3 is file-based, the database is stored within the backend container, and the file is mounted as a volume to persist data.
the command used :docker-compose up --build


2 Orchestration:
Orchestration with Minikube and Kubernetes
For orchestrating the deployment of both the frontend and backend applications, I used Minikube along with Kubernetes. Minikube is a local Kubernetes environment that simulates a production-like setup on a single machine, allowing us to experiment with Kubernetes clusters in a controlled environment.

The orchestration process was carried out by creating a Kubernetes deployment for both the backend and frontend applications, exposing them as services, and ensuring persistent storage for the SQLite database. The orchestration also involved creating Kubernetes resources such as Persistent Volumes (PVs), Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), and setting up communication between the frontend, backend, and the SQLite database.

Step-by-Step Process for Setting Up Orchestration
Setting Up Minikube:

First, I started by setting up Minikube to simulate a local Kubernetes cluster on my machine.
Minikube was installed and started by running the following command:
minikube start --driver=hyperv

SSH Into Minikube:

After starting Minikube, I had to SSH into the Minikube VM to interact with Kubernetes directly.
This was done using:
minikube ssh
then i created the folder where the taskmanager.db will reside in 

i created a kubernetes  folder where all the Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files would reside. These files define how the applications would be deployed, the services that expose them, and the configuration for SQLite.

Kubernetes Resources:
I created the following key Kubernetes resources in the kubernetes/ folder:

Deployments: These YAML files define how the backend and frontend applications should be deployed within the cluster.
Services: These YAML files expose the backend and frontend applications as services within the Kubernetes cluster, enabling communication between them.
Persistent Volumes (PVs): These YAML files define the persistent storage for the SQLite database, ensuring that the data remains available across pod restarts.
Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs): These files request the necessary storage resources for the SQLite database to persist its data.

after creating all these ressources , i simply ran the command:
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes 
from the root directory fo this project (/TaskManager)
hecking Resources and Troubleshooting:

I used various kubectl commands to check the status of pods, services, and other Kubernetes resources:
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
kubectl logs 
kubectl get deployments 
kubectl get pv/pvc

Challenges and Solutions:
One challenge I faced was setting up persistent storage for SQLite within Minikube, as SQLite doesn't typically require a complex database setup. I solved this by using a simple Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim setup to ensure data persistence across pod restarts.

Another challenge was ensuring proper communication between the frontend and backend applications. I addressed this by configuring Kubernetes Services and ensuring that the frontend could access the backend via the internal Kubernetes service name.

Conclusion:
The orchestration using Minikube and Kubernetes allowed me to efficiently deploy, scale, and manage the frontend and backend applications in a containerized environment. With the help of Kubernetes resources such as deployments, services, PVs, and PVCs, I was able to achieve high availability, persistent data storage for SQLite, and seamless interaction between the components. This setup serves as a scalable and reproducible local environment for deploying and testing web applications

3.CI/CD Pipeline for the Project
For continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), I set up a pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for both the backend and frontend applications. GitHub Actions provided an efficient way to integrate with GitHub repositories and manage deployments automatically with minimal intervention.

CI/CD Pipeline Workflow
The workflow in the CI/CD pipeline included the following main steps:

Build:

For both the frontend and backend applications, the pipeline would trigger a build process to package the Docker images. This included building the images using the respective Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend, pushing them to Docker Hub, and ensuring that the latest version of the application was available for deployment.
Test:

After the build, the pipeline would run a set of minimal tests to ensure that the applications were functioning as expected. This step involved running simple HTTP request checks to verify that both the backend and frontend applications were running and could communicate with each other. Since the frontend was a basic vanilla JavaScript application, the test was minimal, such as verifying if the backend service was up and responding.
Deploy:

The final step was to deploy the applications to the orchestrated Kubernetes environment (Minikube). Here, the deployment job would trigger the deployment of the Docker images to the Minikube cluster, applying the necessary Kubernetes configurations for the backend, frontend, and SQLite database.
Challenges with the Deploy Job
While setting up the CI/CD pipeline, I faced a significant challenge with the deploy job. Specifically, I encountered issues when attempting to run Minikube inside a GitHub Actions environment. GitHub Actions is optimized for cloud-based deployments, and running Minikube locally in a GitHub Actions runner is not ideal due to the resource and networking limitations of virtual environments.

Some of the issues I faced included:

Networking and Resource Constraints: Minikube requires local resources and specific network configurations that GitHub Actions could not provide. The GitHub Actions environment is not designed to emulate a full Kubernetes cluster like Minikube, which led to complications in establishing a proper connection between the CI/CD pipeline and the local Kubernetes cluster.

Minikube Setup Time: Starting and configuring Minikube on a GitHub Actions runner took too long and often resulted in timeouts or incomplete setup due to resource limits. This made it difficult to complete the deployment within the required time frame for the pipeline.

Due to these issues, I had to switch from the deploy job to the test job in the pipeline. Instead of trying to deploy directly to Minikube, I focused on ensuring that the application build was correct and the tests ran successfully. This change allowed the pipeline to pass successfully for the build and test phases, even though the deployment step had to be skipped temporarily.

Why Minikube with GitHub Actions Is Not Ideal
Running Minikube within a CI/CD environment like GitHub Actions is not ideal because:

Local Environment Dependency: Minikube relies on local resources, such as a virtual machine or a specific driver (e.g., Docker), which GitHub Actions doesn't support natively. This limits its ability to simulate a Kubernetes cluster in a cloud-based CI/CD pipeline.

Complexity and Maintenance: Setting up and maintaining Minikube inside GitHub Actions is complex, as it requires managing local Kubernetes configurations, SSH access, and resource management, which becomes cumbersome in a cloud-based, ephemeral environment like GitHub Actions.

Lack of Production-Level Features: Minikube is intended for local development and testing. For production or cloud deployments, using more robust solutions like Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is preferred. EKS integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, ensuring better scalability, reliability, and easier management.

Future Improvements: EKS with GitHub Actions
If I had more time to implement a better solution, I would have opted for deploying the applications to Amazon EKS instead of Minikube. Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that offers the following advantages:

Scalability: EKS can scale automatically based on the needs of the application, providing better performance and reliability compared to a local Minikube cluster.

Seamless CI/CD Integration: EKS integrates well with GitHub Actions and other CI/CD tools, providing automated deployment processes without the need for local setups like Minikube. This ensures that the pipeline runs smoothly and reliably, with minimal downtime or configuration issues.

Production-Ready: EKS is designed for production environments, meaning it provides better security, monitoring, and management capabilities for cloud-based applications. This would allow for more efficient and reliable deployment, testing, and scaling of the project in a real-world production environment.

To implement EKS with GitHub Actions, I would:

Set up an EKS Cluster using the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console.
Use GitHub Actions' AWS CLI integration to deploy Docker images to EKS clusters directly from the CI/CD pipeline.
Automate the Kubernetes configuration for EKS (e.g., deployments, services, PVCs, etc.) within the GitHub Actions pipeline.
Conclusion
In summary, the CI/CD pipeline was set up to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for the frontend and backend applications. While I encountered significant challenges with deploying to Minikube within GitHub Actions, I managed to adjust by focusing on the build and test stages. However, if I had more time, I would have integrated Amazon EKS for a more reliable and production-ready orchestration of the application. This would have simplified the CI/CD workflow and allowed for better deployment scalability, especially in cloud environments.
